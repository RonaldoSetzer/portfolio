Jogatina is a web portal with a collection of multiplayer-card games.

My main responsibility was the development of the lobby, the core of the project. The place that connects all games with the server and allows the maximum interaction between the users with game chat, user profile and also create a new match. And also, I was responsible for implementing not only the game logic but also the game rules with unit test (TDD).

The Jogatina portal was developed with the ActionScript 3 and Java programming language with the SmartFoxServer creating the link between them and the multiplayer structure.
