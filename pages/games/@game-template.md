 <p>Music City was a social game developed to the Facebook platform, at Gazeus Games. Where the players have the opportunity to manage their career to become a Rockstar, and also, you will able to buy awesome clothes, famous guitars, microphones, amps, dances and others things to create  the coolest presentation to share via Facebook.</p>

 <p>I was responsible for the game core, creating a scene based on tile map to place the musical instruments, developing our engine to create small video clips and animations based on XML to post on the Facebook timeline or share on Twitter.
 The Music City was developed with the ActionScript 3 to the Client side, Java as a Backend programming language and a NoSQL Database.</p>
